# AoC 2020
My solutions for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) problems. For the most part I'll be using python, though I may switch to Julia for some of them.

## Rankings
I wasn't able to start doing them until day 6 because I was busy with finals, so my rankings for days 1-5 are pretty bad.

| Day                             | Total Time     | Part 1 Rank | Part 2 Rank |
